This is a repository of files that I made during my master's thesis at École Normale Supérieure (ENS) de Rennes and University de Rennes 1, campus Beaulieu. 

* Pre-project learnings directory includes the various scripts I tried to get familiar with spatial data handling and analysis in R by referring to chapters from the book "Geocomputation with R" (https://r.geocompx.org).

* Pre-project renditions directory includes the scripts I tried and tested after obtaining some preliminary Northern Fulmar tracking data and after referring to and modifying scripts from Clark et al. (2023).

* The project directory incudes sub-directories related to hypothesis 1 of my thesis.
  1. Analysis sub-directory includes analysis scripts that I performed for the hypothesis 1 of my thesis.
  2. Discrepancies sub-directory includes scripts which posed unsolved issues related to raster masking whilst producing the final projected home-range raster with masked land polygons.
  3. Latest correct attempt sub-directory includes images, model-related information, unique tracking-year wise distribution images and rasters for each tracked Northern Fulmar from each of the ten colonies in the Northeast Atlantic and resultant csv files for hypothesis 1.
  4. Scripts sub-directory includes all scripts related to hypothesis 1.
  5. Second hypothesis sub-dicretory includes images, input for scripts, outputs (encompasses resultant csv files and raster-masking doubt images) and scripts related to hypothesis 2 of my thesis.
  6. Third hypothesis sub-directory includes images, scripts and resultant csv files related to hypothesis 3 of my thesis.
  7. csv sub-directory includes csv files related to hypothesis 1 of my thesis. 

*  The supplementary information directory includes scripts, csv files and an image contributing to the supplementary information section of my thesis.

*  The thesis images directory includes images, scripts for images and selected representative images (for figure 5) of my thesis.

Files above 25 MB which couldn't be uploaded to GitHub were uploaded under the "Archive" sub-folder in the google drive folder "MS_Thesis_Amey".
